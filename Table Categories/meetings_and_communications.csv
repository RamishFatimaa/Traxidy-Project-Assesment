Dom bought up the fact that the graphics for three digit roadways actually takes up slightly more space than the two digit. Mike mentioned that there had been a couple of cases during testing where the DMS message had defaulted to text instead of using the graphic version (the reason is currently unknown at this time). Mitchel is going to take a look at why the templates might be defaulting for certain locations/events and begin to investigate a solution to the issue of different size messages.",21,"Rebecca Rowat","2022-01-12 01:30:00"
