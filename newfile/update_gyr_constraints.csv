To address this uncertainty, we undertook significant experimentation, prototyping, and innovation efforts. We formulated a hypothesis about the compatibility of different CSV file formats and structures with our application, and tested this hypothesis through systematic experimentation. Through this process, we developed a custom CSV import module that seamlessly integrated with our project work tracking application.

Our R&D efforts focused on developing a new and novel solution to the technological uncertainty, which could not be resolved using standard practice or existing knowledge. By developing a custom software module and implementing enhanced functionality for manipulating and analyzing the data within our application, we were able to significantly improve our project management processes.
