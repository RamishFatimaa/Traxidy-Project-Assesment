<p>Traxidy makes it easier to track, manage and report on Project Actions, Issues, Priorities, Risks and Changes and helps guide meetings and conversations. From the time you learn you have a new project to manage, until you close the project, Traxidy helps to make your role easier.</p>
<p>We purposely designed Traxidy for Project Managers to unify all your day-to-day, real project work and help you stay on track and in control for greater project success. Traxidy is your personal project workspace to complement any project management platform and methodology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Traxidy from the first time you learn about your new project.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>Simply add the new project name to the new project template along with any details you have about the project in the <strong>Project Information </strong>Area<strong>.</strong> You can add more details and information or update at any time.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Add any contacts that will be part of the project in the <strong>Contacts </strong>Area<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Include contacts that will deliver the project as well as key stakeholders that will need to see the <strong>Project Status A</strong>rea. You can easily add contacts at any time.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Use Traxidy <strong>Meetings </strong>Area to establish the meeting schedule that you will use to work with stakeholders to build your project plan.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Each time you meet, use Traxidy to easily record, track and update any key <strong>Actions, Issues, Decisions (AID)</strong>, owners and timing, Risks and Changes and easily create <strong><em>Meeting Minutes</em></strong>. All updates made to Actions, Risks or Changes are available in the record details. The historical updates allow you to see how the information or progress of the work has changed over time.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Use Traxidy to easily show, report and communicate on the real-time <strong>Project Status</strong> as you move through your project work.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Use the Traxidy <strong>High-Level Plan</strong> (<strong>HL Plan</strong>) Area to support the real-time <strong>Project Status</strong> and show your sponsor the high-level view of the project work timeframe and milestones. It can be used as a simplified, stand-alone project plan. Traxidy complements whatever you normally use to develop a project Gantt chart.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Once the plan is approved and set, manage any of the changes to the approved plan in <strong>Changes</strong> and use <strong>Learn &amp; Improve</strong> to record your notes and lessons learned along the way.</li>
</ol>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style=""color: #169179;""><em>Tips!</em></span></h4>
<p>Use Traxidy to better manage and control your project&mdash;in every meeting, after all conversations and during any discussion.</p>
<p>Always have Traxidy open and available to easily add project <strong>Actions, Issues and Decisions (AID)</strong> at any time. <br />As the Project Manager, you <em>know</em> these are details you don&rsquo;t want to forget or leave to chance. Keep all your project work and details consolidated in Traxidy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style=""color: #236fa1;""><em>Best Practice </em></span></h4>
<p>Share your Traxidy screen with all team members during your project <strong>Meetings </strong>so everyone in the meeting can see what you are recording. This will enhance the team trust in your role as a Project Manager. It will ensure that the information captured is understood and agreed-on by everyone as it is recorded.</p>

5,1,3,Navigation in the Traxidy Areas,"<h2><a name=""_Toc63758098""></a>Navigation in the Traxidy Areas</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most systems, Traxidy has a set of terms that we use regularly, many are standard and some are unique to us. Below is a list of key terms to know when working with Traxidy.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Main Menu, Area Names &amp; Terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>For each Project</u>, the sections in Traxidy, as listed on the left side <strong>Main Menu</strong> are called a <strong>Traxidy Area</strong>. The <strong>Traxidy Area Name</strong> will be clearly labelled near the top of each page, along with the Project Name.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://backend-apis.traxidy.com/storage/uploads/CN8DVhZXjcbfyb8k6kr9ZY9ofL0WAPIFXSnsKZTf.jpg"" width=""1057"" height=""521"" /></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Area Records - Expandable Rows per Page</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Traxidy shows a manageable number of records on each Area. Look to the bottom of the current list to show more or less records per page at one time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Traxidy Colors&mdash;Green Yellow Red (GYR)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Traxidy is constantly tracking dates and information and letting you know what may need your attention through data visualization. Colors and charts are used throughout Traxidy to represent the status and key dates of activities including Actions, Risks, Changes and project constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Overall Project Status Color &amp; Elapsed Time Bar</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each project has an <strong>Overall Project</strong> <strong>Status Color and Elapsed Timeframe </strong>bar<strong> </strong>that shows the progress through the project timeframe as a percentage of elapsed time based on the project start date, end date and today&rsquo;s date.</li>
<li>The Overall Project Status Color and Elapsed Timeframe bar is color-coded to show the current <strong>Overall Project Status</strong> with the associated color and letter, Green (G), Yellow (Y) or Red (R).</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Area Record Data Titles</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Area Records</strong> show the information and key details for that record. The information is shown horizontally from left to right, and organized by the Data Titles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Quick Sort on Traxidy Area Record Titles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click on any Area <strong>Record Title</strong> as listed over the Records in any Traxidy Area and the list of records will be sorted by that Title information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Area Charts &amp; Data</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Area Charts</strong> provide a color-coded quick view of the Traxidy Area key stats and data.</li>
<li><strong>Click a chart </strong>and go directly to the Traxidy Area for the details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Key Action Button</h3>
<ul>
<li>Traxidy Area <strong>blue</strong> <strong><em>Key Action</em></strong> buttons provide a quick function for easy management of next steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Collaboration Access Level &nbsp;</h3>
<p>If you provide any of your contacts with either the Access level - Contributor or Reviewer, when the contact signs in to Traxidy, they will begin on the Dashboard Area and the Access Type will appear here.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a Full Access Member and also become a Contributor or Reviewer </strong>on another Member's Traxidy Project, you can simply toggle this area to view your Access Level information. This will be <strong>a different set of information </strong>and Dashboard than your own project Dashboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributor:</strong> Traxidy enables <strong>you to choose to provide access</strong> to any Contact (<strong>Access Type</strong>) so they can access a limited amount of the project information in your Traxidy project allowing them to update <strong>only <em>their</em> (as Owners) Actions and Risks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reviewer: </strong>Traxidy enables you to choose to provide access to any Contact (Access Type) so they can access only the Project Information, Project Status, Constraints GYR and the High-Level Plan. They have <strong>no ability to edit</strong> information and can only see those specific status areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Helpful Icons</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of icons used throughout Traxidy to help you learn more, save time and get the most out of Traxidy.</p>

<li>When a new risk is recorded in the <strong>Project Risks </strong>Area, you will select the percent <strong>Probability</strong> of the risk occurring and the level of <strong>Impact</strong> the risk would have, to create the Risk Score.</li>
<li>Each risk receives a <strong>Risk Score</strong>. Each risk is evaluated by you and your team by applying both a percentage<strong> Probability </strong>(that the risk will happen) and the<strong> Impact </strong>the risk would have on the project (if it was to occur).

<ul>
<ul>
<li>If the RRL is set <u>too low</u>&mdash;most risk scores will be <strong>above the RRL</strong> and most risks will then be ranked and will appear to be important.</li>
<li>It would be expected that all ranked risks be monitored and managed. Traxidy prioritizes and reports these risks for you.</li>
<li>If the RRL is set <u>too high</u>&mdash;most risk scores will fall <strong>below the RRL</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>will not be </strong><strong>ranked. </strong>Traxidy will record but not prioritize and report these unranked risks.</li>
<li>The Project Risk Rank Line can be <strong>changed at any time</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Important Risks are Ranked Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Traxidy, if a risk is &lsquo;<strong>Ranked&rsquo;</strong> it will be shown to be important, it will be tracked and reported and you will need to manage or work on it. It will have a Risk Score <strong>equal to or above the RRL</strong>.</li>
<li>If a risk is <strong>not &lsquo;Ranked&rsquo;,</strong> it is not tracked or monitored or reported and does not need to be actively managed by you. It will have a Risk Score <strong>below the RRL</strong>.</li>

<h3>PROJECT EXAMPLE:</h3>
<p>For this example the Risk Rank Line (RRL) has been set in Project Settings with the Probability <strong>70%</strong> and Impact <strong>3</strong> out of 5.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Risk Rank Line = 70 x 3 = 210.</li>
<li>The Project RRL is set at <strong>210</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example,<em> &lsquo;There is a new risk to the project that the development team will not be able to hire a new resource when they are needed for the project.&rsquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Team estimates a<strong><em> Probability</em></strong> of this risk occurring at <strong>75%</strong></li>
<li>The Team estimates an<strong><em> Impact</em></strong> to the project if this risk was to happen at <strong>4</strong> out of 5</li>
<li>The Impacted Key <strong>Constraint</strong> for this risk is the <strong><em>Schedule</em></strong></li>
<li>The calculated<strong> Risk Score</strong> is 75 x 4 = 300</li>
<li>This Risk Score of 300 is above the Risk Rank Line (RRL) of 210&mdash;so this risk <em>will</em> show as a &lsquo;Ranked Risk&rsquo;.</li>
<li>All &lsquo;Ranked Risks&rsquo; are listed in order of their Risk Score, with the highest Risk Score ranked #1.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;""><em>Tips!</em></span></h3>
<p>Some of your projects may be more or less sensitive to risks and the time required to manage those risks. Traxidy gives you the ability to match that sensitivity and control the Risk Rank Line (the Risk Score cut-off) for each specific project.</p>
<h3>Select Your Color for Top Ranked Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Traxidy provides the option to color-code a select number of Top <strong>Ranked Risks</strong> for at-a-glance priority views.</li>
<li>Traxidy tracks all ranked open risks, and provides the option to add a color bar to the risk records in the <strong>Risk </strong>Area with the <strong>highest Risk Scores</strong>, to assist in priority views and discussions.</li>
<li>In your Project Settings, click <strong>Risk Rank Line</strong>, and <strong>Color for Top Ranked Risks</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the number of Top Ranked Risks and the associated color to easily identify priority risks.</li>
</ul>

<p>To save you time, you only have to type a contact&rsquo;s name into Traxidy once. From then on, it can be easily found in any contact drop-down field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Constraints &amp; Importance</h3>
<p><strong>Consider</strong>: Which of the three main project constraints are the most important for <em>this</em> project, Scope, Schedule or Budget? Is one more important than another?</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the relative weighting of importance of the three main project constraints, Scope, Schedule and Budget helps you to better understand the criticality of successfully managing each of these project aspects. This is especially true if changes are needed later in the project. In the <strong>Key Constraints Weighting</strong> section, the Key Constraints and weighting of importance will total 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Best Practice</h4>
<p>Reviewing <strong>Key Constraint Weighting</strong> of importance with your Project Sponsor is a great opportunity to clarify the importance of each constraint. It is vital that all team members are aware and aligned on the key constraints and relative importance for a specific project.</p>

26,1,8,The Value of a Scope Statement,"<h3>The Value of a Scope Statement</h3>
<p>A New Project set up includes detailing the Project Scope Statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>The project <strong>Scope Statement</strong> usually comes from knowledge of the project through a project requirements document.</li>
<li>Make the Scope Statement as long and as detailed as you need. The text box is unlimited.</li>
<li>The Scope Statement builds upon the key deliverables and expected benefits, the schedule and budget. Add the information you have now and update with more details following discussions with your stakeholders and especially with your sponsor or client.</li>
<li>The Scope Statement provides a key piece of information when exporting or printing the <strong>Project Information</strong> Area in Traxidy. The resulting report can be used as a high level Project Charter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Scope Statement can be <strong>updated anytime in the Project Information</strong> Area</p>

<p>A New Project set up includes the addition of key project dates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>Project Start Date</strong>, based on the agreed upon start date with sponsor and or clients. The start date will appear on the Project Information and Project Status Area and will be treated as firm.</li>
<li>The <strong>Project</strong> <strong>End Date</strong> and the <strong>Budget </strong>are typically entered with an &lsquo;Estimate&rsquo; status to start, until the entire project plan has been presented to the client or sponsor and dates and costs become &lsquo;Firm&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Once the project plan details and the <strong>End Date </strong>are agreed-to, then it is important to ensure the <em>Status</em> of the End Date is changed to Firm.</li>
<li>Note that any change(s) to the Project End Date should be updated in the <strong>Approved</strong> <strong>Revised End Date </strong>in the<strong> Project Information </strong>Area<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;"">Best Practice</span></h3>
<p>Keeping an up-to-date record of changes is important and a key capability that Traxidy helps with. Remember that once your <strong>Project End Date</strong> is &lsquo;Firm&rsquo; then it is best practice to record any further changes to that date in the box titled <strong>Approved Revised End Date. </strong>A history of those<strong> changes are tracked</strong> in Traxidy for future reference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Traxidy to easily record <strong>Issues</strong> as they are discovered, and manage all related actions effectively.</p>
<p>Access AID from the left Navigation Panel, click Project Name and click <strong>Actions, Issues Decisions AID</strong>. You can also start from the Dashboard, and click on the AID chart in the Project Record</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Use Traxidy to better track all your project work details in one place.</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the project <strong>plan is</strong> <strong>developed</strong>&mdash;Issues may be uncovered.<strong> </strong>Discussions, meetings and interactions lead to issues or key next steps that you need to record, track and report on as you work towards finalizing the plan.</li>
<li>Once the project <strong>plan is</strong> <strong>set</strong>&mdash;Issues may be discovered<strong>. </strong>Discussions, meetings and interactions lead to Issues that potentially challenge the plan. Actions need to be accomplished to overcome the issues and keep the plan on track. Record, track and report all actions until the project is closed.</li>
<li>The Traxidy <strong>AID</strong> Area is your place for all project Actions, Issues and Decisions (AID), including descriptions, priorities, owners, progress, due date and status.</li>
<li>Record everything you want to track in your project&mdash;especially the day-to-day real work details that support the actual project plan or Gantt chart. As a project manager, you often manage many <strong>additional pieces of work</strong> that are not specifically noted on the project plan or Gantt Chart.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate with Action Owners.</strong> To collaborate with your team doing the work, ensure actions are connected with the proper owners<em>.</em> Set up the owner with the <strong>Access Type -</strong> <strong>Edit Actions </strong>(see <strong>Contacts</strong> Area, Access Type options).</li>
<li>Also, ensure you have a scheduled due date for the action and let Traxidy do the tracking for you.</li>
<li><strong>View and Sort by Issue or Priority</strong>&mdash;Simplify and direct meeting discussions by using the Sorting feature in AID. Quickly sort by issue and view all the associated actions across owners and dates or sort by priority, and focus your time on the highest priority issues and actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Status Tracking Helps You Focus</h3>
<p>Traxidy does the action tracking for you, based on the action due date and multiple status intervals and provides a fast focus of the critical work that needs to be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Action status due date intervals helps you focus. The AID Area <strong>Actions Overview</strong> chart and the record <strong>Due Status</strong> intervals include:
<ul>
<li>Past Due</li>
<li>Due Today</li>
<li>Due in 2 Days</li>
<li>Due in 5 days</li>
<li>Due Later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quickly see all <strong>Actions Past Due </strong>by clicking the <strong>Status </strong>title above the AID Records to sort all action records. Past Due records will be at the top, then Due Today and so on, in the order of importance of the time remaining.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Easy Follow Up with Action &amp; Risk Owners</h3>
<p>The way to save time and easily follow up and get Action (or Risk planning) updates directly from Owners is to ensure the Contact and Owner of an Action or Risk, is setup to collaborate on the project with you.</p>
<p>In the Contact Details, ensure the Owner has the Access Type - Collaborator (see Contacts Area, Access Type options). This will grant the Oner access to Traxidy and only the Actions or Risks they are connected to as ""Owners"". They <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">see nothing else</span> other than the Project Information Area.</p>
<p>This will allow the Action Owners to see and update their specific Actions or Risks anytime. Once anyone with Contributor Access has updated their work, the system has a notification show in the Notification Bell at the top of the Dashboard Area (or email as set up in Project Settings will be sent to you) showing the latest update and exactly when it was done.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Important Charts in AID</h3>
<p>There are three charts to easily visualize your project priorities for Actions, Issues and Decisions and next best steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong><strong>Issues by Priority:</strong> get a quick view of the total number of issues by priority including Escalated, High, Medium and Low.</li>
<li><strong> </strong><strong>Actions Overview:</strong> view of all Actions and status for quick focus.</li>
<li><strong> </strong><strong>Decisions Made:</strong> tracking the Decisions made by date across the project timeframe.</li>

<h3>Risk Assessment &amp; Prioritization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the <strong>Risk Statement</strong> and describe the Risk in a short sentence. The description could start with words like &lsquo;<em>There is a risk that &hellip; may happen, and if it happens then it will affect the project key constraint of &hellip;&rsquo;</em></li>
<li><strong>Reminder</strong>: A Risk is something that <em>may</em> happen <em>and</em> <em>will</em> have an impact on your project.</li>
<li>Use Traxidy as your step-by-step guide to assess a risk and prioritize the work on the risk, by following the next steps:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>Record the Risk and Identify the Constraint(s) Impacted</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Calculate the Risk Score through Probability &amp; Impact</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Obtain the Risk Ranking &amp; Prioritization</li>
</ol>
<h3>Identify the Key Constraint Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the Impacted Key Constraint drop-down box, indicate which key project constraint(s) will be impacted the most.
<ul>
<li>Indicate whether it is the Scope (or Goals, Benefits), Schedule or Budget or a combination.</li>
<li>This helps to better understand the risk and what might be done to reduce the impact (Mitigation) or the when developing a strategy if the risk presents itself (Contingency).</li>

<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;"">Best Practice</span></h3>
<p>Understanding the weighting or importance of the Key Constraints (see Project Information) will influence the impact a risk may have on the project.&nbsp; A risk that will have an impact on the highest weighted Key Constraint should generally have a higher impact (number).</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;""><em>Tips!</em></span></h3>
<p>Knowing the key constraints that would be most impacted if a risk becomes a reality, will also help with the explanation of the change requirement(s), when creating a Change Request record if it is required. Use Traxidy to help create and submit a Change Request Form for approval (see Traxidy <strong>Changes</strong> Area).</p>
<h3>A Calculated Risk Score for Each Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Scores &amp; Assessment:</strong> Each risk receives a <strong>Risk Score</strong> that is estimated by you and your team, by applying both a percentage<strong> Probability </strong>(that the risk will happen) and the<strong> Impact </strong>the risk would have on the project (if it was to occur). The multiplication of these two numbers is the <strong>Risk Score.</strong></li>
<li>The higher the Risk Score, the more critical it is to monitor and manage the risk by developing a Mitigation and a Contingency plan associated with the risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risk Scores and Priority Ranking</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranked Risks are Prioritized:</strong> From your choice of the Probability and Impact, Traxidy will calculate the Risk Score and rank each risk as compared to the other risks you have recorded. The ranking of a risk is indicated in the <strong>Risk Rank</strong> box and is system generated.</li>
<li>If a Risk Score is on or above the Risk Rank Line (RRL), the risk is<strong> ranked as high priority </strong>and considered important.
<ul>
<li>Ranked Risks are prioritized and will be tracked and reported on, making it easier for you to manage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a Risk Score is below the Risk Rank Line (RRL), the risk is not considered a priority and the Risk Rank box will indicate <em>&lsquo;Not Ranked&rsquo;</em>.
<ul>
<li>Risks that are <strong>Not Ranked </strong>are not prioritized. The risk has been recorded, however it does not need to be monitored and managed unless you have time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Risk Rank Line (RRL) &amp; Prioritization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Think of the RRL as the prioritization line or cut-off point. Risks on or above the RRL are ranked and prioritized.</li>
<li>The risks that score <strong>on or</strong> <strong>above the RRL</strong> (ranked risks) are important, high <strong>priority risks</strong> that you will need to focus on and<strong> </strong>take time to monitor, plan for and manage<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Any risks that score <strong>below the RRL</strong> (they are not Ranked) are a low priority. They have been recorded, but typically, you would <strong>not</strong> <strong>manage</strong> them unless you have the time.<br /><br /></li>

49,1,13,Setting Priorities with the Risk Rank Line (RRL),"<h2>Setting Priorities with the Risk Rank Line (RRL)</h2>
<p>There are two ways to set the Risk Rank Line to assess and prioritize risks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>Directly on the Traxidy <strong>Risks</strong> Area in the <strong>Risk Rank Line chart</strong> on the top of the page or,</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Select the <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Settings Gear</strong> in the top Navigation bar of each project, to access <strong>Project Settings</strong>, and then click on <strong>Risk Rank Line (RRL) </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To set the Risk Rank Line (RRL) for risk prioritization, select any Probability and Impact from the drop-down menu. Ranked Risks are high priority and have Risk Scores equal to or above the RRL. The Traxidy RRL makes it easier to focus and manage your time and efforts.
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> the RRL default setting is 210 and is calculated by using a 70% Probability and a 3 out of 5 Impact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Risk Rank Line (RRL) can be <strong>set anywhere on the scale</strong> for each project. As the risks for each project are different, set the RRL to meet your project needs.
<ul>
<li>Select a <strong>Probability</strong> of the risk occurring, between 5% to 95% and the <strong>Impact</strong> of the risk, between 1 to 5, with 1 having a very low impact and 5 having a very high impact if the risk was to occur.</li>
<li>The highest RRL on the scale is 475 by using 95% Probability and 5 Impact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Risk Rank Line (RRL) and Ranked Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risk Rank Line (RRL) helps to identify the prioritized, ranked risks that are seen as important and need to be monitored and managed.</li>
<li>Think of the RRL as the prioritization line or cut-off point. Risks on or above the RRL are ranked and prioritized.
<ul>
<li>The risks that score <strong>on or</strong> <strong>above the RRL</strong> (ranked risks) are important, high <strong>priority risks</strong> that you will need to focus on and<strong> </strong>manage<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Any risks that score <strong>below </strong><strong>the RRL</strong> (they are <strong>not</strong> <strong>Ranked</strong>) are a low priority. They have been recorded, but typically, you would not manage them unless you have time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Project Risk Rank Line for the Project can be changed at any time.</li>
<li>Traxidy will automatically calculate the Risk Score for each risk as you apply the percentage <strong>Probability</strong> (that the risk will happen) and the <strong>Impact </strong>on the project (if the risk occurs). The <strong>Risk Score</strong> is the multiplication of the Probability and Impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;""><em>Tips! </em></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>If the RRL is set <u>too <strong>low</strong></u>, most risks will be <strong>ranked</strong> and will be considered a priority. This means that essentially <em>most</em> of your project risks will be tracked and need your time to be managed.</li>
<li>If the RRL is set <u>too <strong>high</strong></u>, most risks will <strong>not be ranked</strong> and will be considered low priority. This means that <em>very few</em> risks will be tracked and managed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Example Risk Rank Line (RRL) and Ranked Risks</h3>
<p>For this project example, the Risk Rank Line (RRL) for priority tracking has been set at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probability 70% and Impact 3 out of 5 (1 is low, 5 is high)</li>
<li>Risk Rank Line (RRL) = 70 x 3 which is 210</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For this example,</strong> <em>&lsquo;There is a risk to the project that the development team will not have the new resource hired by the time they are needed on the project.&rsquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The team estimates a risk<strong><em> </em>Probability</strong> of this occurring = 75%</li>
<li>The team estimates a risk<strong> </strong><strong>Impact</strong> if this was to happen = 4 out of 5</li>
<li>The calculated<strong> Risk Score</strong> = 75 x 4 which is 300</li>
<li>This Risk Score of 300 is above the RRL of 210</li>
<li>This Risk is above the RRL and will be shown as a <strong>Ranked Risk </strong>and considered a priority</li>
<li>All the &lsquo;Ranked Risks&rsquo; are sorted in order of their Risk Score, with <strong>the highest Risk </strong><strong>Score</strong> <strong>ranked #1, as the highest priority.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img src=""https://backend-apis.traxidy.com/storage/uploads/WvSzQDdyblcqDx2TvC3RUWbVd9uXMW5fnWhTpEen.jpg"" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;""><em>Tips!</em></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Traxidy will track and report all the ranked, priority risks that remain open.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Probability</strong> (P): set the probability of the risk happening between 5% and 95%.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Impact</strong> (I): set the impact if the risk happens between 1 (low) and 5 (very high).</li>
<li><strong>Risk Score</strong> (P) x (I): the higher the score, the more critical it is to manage the risk.</li>
<li><strong>Ranked Risks</strong>: all the priority risks, on or above the RRL are to be monitored and managed.</li>
<li><strong>Top Ranked Risks Color-coded</strong>: select the number of Top Ranked Risks and the associated color for at-a-glance high-risk priority views.</li>
<li><strong>Ranked Risks &amp; Charts:</strong> Ranked Risks will be reflected in multiple Traxidy Areas including your Project Dashboard, Project Information, Risks, Constraints GYR, and Project Status.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;"">Best Practice</span></h3>
<p>Every project has risks. Record, track and manage the priority Project Risks throughout the life of the project. As the project progresses, your Project Team Members are your best source for collecting these potential threats and impacts to your project.</p>",2021-12-08 12:50:07,2021-12-08 12:50:07
50,1,14,Easily Update Risks,"<h2>Easily Update Risks</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are essentially two pieces of information that may continue to be updated when managing a Risk: the plans for risk <strong>Mitigation</strong> and <strong>Contingency</strong>. Each update to the mitigation or contingency plan is kept in the Traxidy Risk Record details history. This allows you to easily see how the information or movement of the work has changed over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mitigation </strong></h3>
<p>Mitigation is the specific plan of action to be taken to avoid or reduce the probability of the risk occurring. Include costs and time associated with this Mitigation plan.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><strong>Contingency </strong></h3>
<p>Contingency is the specific plan of action to be taken to reduce the impact of the risk if the risk does occur. Include costs and time associated with this Contingency plan. A Change Request may need to be added to support this Contingency plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each update that is made to the risk mitigation or contingency plan is kept in the risk record historical details for easy reference.</li>
<li>You can add more information and make updates at any time. From the Risk Area, simply click on the Risk Record and the Risk Details Window will open on the right side.</li>
<li>Choose to update the appropriate tab including Mitigation or Contingency.</li>
<li>When the risk can no longer have an effect on the project, set the <strong>Status</strong> to <strong>Closed</strong>, and the Risk Record will automatically move to the <strong>Closed Tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;"">Best Practice</span></h3>
<p>Revisit your risk records at various times throughout the project. As the project moves closer to ending or using the approved budget, the risks that could have had a minor impact earlier in the project may now carry more impact if they were to occur at this point in time.</p>

<li>Use the change in status color to signify to your manager that there is an issue worth discussing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Traxidy GYR Guidelines</h3>
<p>The Traxidy GYR guide for using colors to identify project and constraint status includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green (G): </strong>use status G if the project is on plan, ok or good (including all actions, risks and changes proceeding as planned).</li>
<li><strong>Yellow (Y):</strong> use status Y if there is an impactful problem/issue that is following set actions and next steps are being monitored closely.</li>
<li><strong>Red (R): </strong>use status R if the expected work to resolve the problem is not seeming to work or the solution is difficult to formulate and critical focus and potentially more experience or authority is required.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Assessment Required: 4 Main Inputs</h3>
<p>In any project, the assessment of the status by the Project Manager is of the utmost importance. No one is closer to the entire scope of the work than the Project Manager.</p>
<p>At any point when you are assessing the current project status situation, it is important to remember the four assessments that you will be reporting on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>PM Certainty of Success
<ul>
<li><em>Set a percentage<br /><br /></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong> </strong>PM Estimate of Work Complete
<ul>
<li><em>Set a percentage </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong> </strong>The Overall Project Status Color
<ul>
<li><em>Set GYR and add comments</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Key Constraints Status Color
<ul>
<li><em>Set GYR and add comments</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>PM Certainty of Success</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Set your assessment of the certainty of project success, based on the current real-world situation and your experience. This is a very subjective account of what you think the chances of this project are for being a total success.</li>
<li>Most sponsors and managers would appreciate your project insight. Be prepared to explain this assessment. Set the project success assessment as a percentage selected from the drop-down menu, 0% to 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>PM Percentage of Work Complete</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Set your assessment of project work complete. This can be taken from a Gantt chart application or it is your best-estimate from what you know about the current situation of the project execution. Your assessment is selected from the drop-down menu, 0% to 100%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Overall Project Status Color</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The assessment of the Overall Project Status Color can be based on your organization&rsquo;s description of the use of these colors or your own method of understanding or the Traxidy GYR guidelines above.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> are needed when the project status is Yellow or Red. Ideally, the comments answer &ldquo;why&rdquo; the project is that color, and lists the ownership, timing and actions being taken.</li>
<li><strong>Note: </strong>All the Traxidy Areas work together and the<strong> Project Status Area consolidates information from multiple areas</strong> including the Constraints GYR. Project Status provides an opportunity to add comments to the Constraints GYR and outline the <strong>Actions to Change Status</strong> to return the overall project status color back to Green.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>Key Constraint Status Color</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the project Key Constraints, <strong>Scope, Schedule</strong> and <strong>Budget</strong> can be assessed with a status color, GYR to more specifically explain why the <em>Overall</em> Project Status Color is Yellow or Red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the Overall Project Status, each of the key constraints has an open text field to add comments if the key constraint is Yellow or Red.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong> that the project Key Constraints and current GYR status color and comments appears in the <strong>Project Status</strong> Area and becomes a part of any Project Status report.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;""><em>Tips!</em></span></h3>
<p>A status change to Yellow or Red, would typically come from an Issue and Actions recorded in the AID Area. Reference the Traxidy Issue ID in the comment section of the Overall Status or any of the Key Constraints (along with the Yellow or Red status explanation). This provides a clear record and full details for discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #1319ee;"">Best Practice</span></h3>
<p>Ideally, the best practice is to not have a project go directly from Green to RED. Always keep your client/sponsor/manager informed. Try to assess the situation as quickly as possible in terms of planning for actions (Yellow) to get the project back on track. Decide quickly if a critical focus is required and the status needs to move to RED. If possible, discuss the status with your manager immediately and <em>before</em> changing the status to RED.</p>",2021-12-08 14:00:50,2022-03-05 09:52:31

<ol>
<li><strong> </strong>Overall Status Comment</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Milestones</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Key Accomplishments</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Next Steps</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note </strong>that these sections require some thought, consideration and your updated comments <strong>before the Status Report can be finalized</strong> and ready to be sent.</p>
<ul>
<li>All other areas of the Project Status Report are pulled directly from the specific Traxidy Area and do not require updates here. If a specific Traxidy Area needs to be updated, go directly to the area, make your updates, and they will automatically be reflected in the <strong>Project Status</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Overall Status Comment</strong>: <u>Add a short comment</u> on why the project is the status color that it is. If the project is not Green, provide comments about the <strong>Actions to Change Status</strong> back to Green, the ownship and timelines. The <strong>Overall Current Status Color</strong> is set in the Constraints GYR Area.</p>
<p><img src=""https://backend-apis.traxidy.com/storage/uploads/xaRGhrXJoYM8s1MEf6rgtNmvn436UwmOdQUq9DDM.jpg"" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Milestones</strong>: <u>Add your key project milestones</u> including the plan date to complete and the GYR status color for each specific milestone. The milestones can be updated at any time for the next Project Status report</p>

<h3>Other Information from the Constraints GYR Area</h3>
<p>Be sure to review all pieces of information presented in the Project Status Area to ensure the information is current and accurate before you save and send it.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PM Estimate of Work Complete: </strong>It is important to show <em>your</em> estimate of the work complete for each status report. It may <em>not</em> be in line with the current<strong> Timeline Duration Complete</strong> as more work may be coming later in the project, or more work may have already been completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note </strong>that the <strong>Timeline Duration Complete</strong> is a system calculated number based on how many work days are between the project Start Date, the project End Date and Today&rsquo;s Date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If a project is 10 days long and today&rsquo;s date is 5 days into the project, the Timeline Duration Complete is 50% (or 5 days out of 10 days have completed).</p>

<li>Are there any new deliverables? Corresponding Milestones?</li>
<li>What impact will the change have on the plan, scope, schedule and budget?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Determine the impact of the change before changing the status to Submitted and sending the Change Request to the person who needs to approve/review it next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Submitted</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Submitted </strong>Change Status means that the Change Request has been submitted to the Approver for review and possible approval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Approved</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Approved </strong>Change Status indicates that the Change Request has been approved. The financial impact and work days impact as listed in the Change Request has been approved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Declined</strong></h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Declined </strong>Change Status if the proposed Change Request has been rejected. The Declined Change Records will be kept in the <strong>Declined Tab</strong> for easy reference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your approved change request has any <strong>Work Days Impact</strong> involved with the change, then it is assumed that the end date for the project will need to be changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traxidy <strong>does not automatically change the project end date</strong>, since this is a very important aspect of the project reporting. It is important that you revisit the Project Information area and ensure you update the New Approved Project End Date once you have made the ajustments to your plan and or budget. You may also need to review the existing project deliverables in this area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>New Project End Date?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Review your plan for the proper project end date</li>
<li>Input the new project end date in the <strong>Project Information</strong> area</li>

<ul>
<li>A project Work Week is set in Project Settings with the option for either a 5 or 7 day work week. The default is set at 5 Work Days per week.</li>
<li>It is important to note that multiple system generated results in Traxidy are based on the Work Week and number of Work Days you have set for your project. The following numbers in Traxidy are affected by this setting:
<ul>
<li>Original Work Days (Project Information)</li>
<li>Approved Revised Work Days (Project Information)</li>
<li>Added Work Days (Project Status)</li>
<li>Total Work Days (Project Status)</li>

70,1,18,Making Approved Changes to Schedule,"<h2><a name=""_Toc69397665""></a>Making Approved Changes to Schedule</h2>
<p>Changes to the project timeframe may include changes to the original schedule, and a change to the Project End Date, which will then impact the overall number of work days and the number of work days remaining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approved Revised End Date</strong> &ndash;if a project schedule change has been approved, record it in the Project Information Area. Hover over the Approved Revised End Date and the section will turn grey allowing you to enter in the latest, newly revised end date. <br /><br />
<ul>
<li>The update to the Approved Revised End Date will also automatically update the information in the Project Status Area.<br /><br /></li>
<li>A record of all the adjustments to the Original End Date will be kept in the Project Information Area for your reference if needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing the Original End Date Instead of the Approved Revised End Date</p>
<p>When setting the Original End Date, there is a <strong>status</strong> setting of <strong>Firm or Estimate.</strong> A Firm date status would imply that an agreed-upon end date for the project has been approved and from that point onward it will require a Change Request to move/revise this date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traxidy supports this assumption by presenting a <strong>pop-up warning</strong> if there is an attempt to edit the <strong>Original End Date</strong> once the status is <em>Firm</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry, Traxidy <u>allows you to edit the original End Date</u> even if the date status is &lsquo;Firm&rsquo;. It is important to know that Traxidy keeps track of all the Approved Revised End Date changes throughout the project timeframe. Having a record of these changes is valuable to the integrity of the project information and reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A record of all the historic changes to the Original End Date will be available there in the</p>
<p>Project Information Area by clicking on the History icon.<img src=""https://backend-apis.traxidy.com/storage/uploads/lhB8LQOsrPIx8H3mDoHr82qF15MSlVYpIVW2PUHX.jpg"" /></p>

<h3><span style=""color: #0025fd;""><em>Tips!</em></span></h3>
<p>We recommend that you keep the Original Project End Date intact and not over-write it. Keep a record of the changes to the original approved schedule by indicating the new end date in the Approved Revised End Date in the <strong>Project</strong> <strong>Information</strong> Area.</p>

72,1,20,Capture Project Learnings,"<h2>Capture Project Learnings</h2>
<p>The <strong>Learnings </strong>Area is used for capturing your project notes, ideas and lessons learned throughout the project. This area is all about learning from your experience and optimizing project performance and success. Use the information for yourself, share and discuss with team members and use for Post Project Reviews. Learn during the project timeframe and improve project delivery results and team and client satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easily record detailed notes and ideas including actions to repeat and opportunities to explore/change in your next project. Sort, search and reference your notes at any time. Remember that other project managers, taking on similar projects in the future, may learn from this information as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4 Pieces of Information</h3>
<p>There are key pieces of learning information to collect as part of lessons learned including impact, business area, issue and impact descriptions and next time. The Traxidy Learn &amp; Improve model makes it easier to retrieve/sort learnings and information for any Post Project Review or Post Mortem.</p>
<p>From the <strong>Learnings</strong> Area click the <strong><em>+ New Learning</em></strong> button to open the New Learning window.</p>
<p><img src=""https://backend-apis.traxidy.com/storage/uploads/SOdc1SCSFAa24Hqq2B79vEjKHq5i5BaFcwAkA3OX.jpg"" width=""710"" height=""248"" /></p>
<h3>Impact on Project (+/-)</h3>
<p>Simply select either the plus sign &ldquo;+&rdquo;, for a positive impact or the negative sign &ldquo;-&ldquo;, if the learning had a negative impact on the project.</p>
<p>Some situations that arise during a project have a negative effect and some have a positive effect. Some lessons learned have a positive impact on project results and are learnings that we want to repeat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Main Business Area Involved</h3>
<p>The Main Business Area involved in the learning is a main aspect of the information collected and helps to align ownership with suggested changes that may be required in the project delivery process. Knowing the Main Business Area and opportunities to work differently next time may also help to improve project quality and outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Issue Description &amp; Impact on Project</h3>
<p>The <em>What</em>: The <strong>Issue Description</strong> captures the details of the learning situation that you think should be repeated (good/+) or not repeated (not good/-) for the next project. &ldquo;What went <em>well</em>?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What went <em>wrong</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>How</em>: The <strong>Impact on Project</strong> describes how the project was affected by the situation. This typically involves key constraints including scope, schedule and budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Learn &amp; Improve for Next Time</h3>
<p>Add the description of what you have learned and will use to Improve for Next Time. This include a new approach, a new solution or a process change. This learning should align with the Main Business area Involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://backend-apis.traxidy.com/storage/uploads/HJuXjjCX0DMXkLA7i2f69e7D2QMeBDeg0W7eP02p.jpg"" width=""511"" height=""399"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #0025fd;""><em>Tips!</em></span></h3>
<p>It is important to <strong>Learn &amp; Improve</strong> through the recognition of what can be done better. This will help to provide the continuous improvement of your abilities and the project results. It is also vital to include &ldquo;What went well?&rdquo; as a part of any post project review discussion to determine various aspects of the project delivery that need to be repeated.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #0025fd;"">Best Practice</span></h3>
<p>There is no reason to wait until the end of a project to capture lessons learned. Don't wait for a Post Project Review to record the information. Record your experiences, ideas and learnings, positive and negative as they happen. Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to indicate Project Management as the Main Business area Involved.</li>
<li>Be sure to review your notes before starting any other projects. This will help you and your team to learn and improve for next time.</li>
<li>Leverage your Project learnings notes to support the post project review or post mortem.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working as a Consultant, you may have some projects involving one client and other projects that are managed for a different client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have the steps for you to use Traxidy in a live meeting, to show the Client the status of multiple projects <strong>without showing the other projects</strong> that are not connected with that Client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Scenario: </strong>You&rsquo;re a Consultant managing several Projects for multiple clients. For this example we will assume you are working with <strong>Client1 </strong>managing Projects 1, 2 and 3, and you are managing Projects 4 and 5 with <strong>Client2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Drill Down to Specific Project Details with Interactive Charts&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Traxidy Personal Projects Dashboard is all about helping the Member to focus their time each day. It allows you to quickly drill down to more details and go directly to multiple areas by clicking any one of the project charts. The Information Tiles across the top of the Dashboard show the total portfolio and status of the projects you are managing. The individual Project Records show the Overall Status Color, timeframe complete and multiple charts for each key project area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Be Ready for Each Client Presentation &ndash; View and Hide Projects Temporarily</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To show your Dashboard and project details in a meeting with Client1 and review only Projects 1, 2 and 3, simply remove Projects 4 and 5 that are not involved with this client.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Remove a project from the main Dashboard (temporarily) by selecting and clicking the box on the projects you want to hide and then click Manage &gt; Close. Press continue after the warning confirmation window pops up.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Don&rsquo;t worry. All the project information is still in your Traxidy account and readily availble. It&rsquo;s not deleted. The project and all its information has been moved from your Dashboard and Active Project Areas to the Closed Projects Folder. Once a project is closed, it will be available in the Closed Projects Folder and can be accessed from the Main Menu on the left navigation panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Your Dashboard is now focused on Client1&rsquo;s projects and ready for discussions. You can click on any one project, to review Project Status, Constraints and the High-Level Plan. You decide what to show.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Make Your Projects &lsquo;Active&rsquo; Again</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bring projects back to &lsquo;Active&rsquo; and availble on your Dashboard, simply open the Closed Projects Folder in Main Menu on the left navigation panel and click on each individual project you want to &lsquo;Open&rsquo; again.</p>
<p>After clicking, the Project Information Area will open. Change the project &lsquo;Mode&rsquo; from &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; to &lsquo;Open&rsquo; in the drop down menu. The project will then be back on your Dashboard and all of its Project Areas and information will be just as it was when it was Closed.</p>
